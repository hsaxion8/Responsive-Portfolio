            My name is Hamilton, I'm currentyly living in Olathe, KS with my wife, Ally, and my daughter, Saylor. We're
            expecting another girl who is due on Christmas Day!
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm from the great state of Texas! I love my Cowboys and Texas BBQ. This year, I started cycling and
            quickly developed a passion for it. I'm hoping to make an 8 day cycling trip across Kansas next year!
            <br>

            Currenty, I'm the Sales and Marketing Manager for Alternative Health Labs. We sell all natural vitamins and
            minerals. I've been working at this job for over 6 years now. I love my job but I am looking forward
            starting a new career as a web developer.
